Expense Tracker 💰

Expense Tracker is a fully responsive web application built using Django and Tailwind CSS, designed to help users manage their personal finances efficiently. The application allows users to track expenses and incomes, view detailed summaries, and export financial data in multiple formats.

This project reflects my hands-on experience in Python Full Stack Development, focusing on secure authentication, clean backend architecture, and a modern responsive UI.
